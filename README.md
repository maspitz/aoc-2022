My Solutions (in Python) for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

## Project structure
Each day's solution is kept in NN/dayNN.py

Run `python NN/dayNN.py` to solve the puzzle.
This includes fetching of the puzzle data via the [`advent-of-code-data`](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) package.
The solutions are printed to stdout, because I prefer to submit solutions in the browser.

## Testing
Run `pytest` or `pytest NN` to test day NN.

The tests are written against the sample data, not the puzzle data.
